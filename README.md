🌐 Language Translation Tool

🚀 Overview

The Language Translation Tool is a Python-based project that allows users to translate text into different languages using the Google Translator API. Users can also view available languages starting with a specific letter.

📌 Features

-  ✅ Accepts user input for the text to be translated
-  ✅ Allows translation to any language using a language code (e.g., en, fr, te)
-  ✅ Displays translation results
-  ✅ Lists all available languages starting with a user-specified letter
-  ✅ Handles errors for invalid language codes or translation failures

📦 Libraries Used

-  🔥 googletrans - For translation services using Google Translator
-  🔥 LANGUAGES - To list available languages supported by the Google Translator API

🎯 How It Works

-  ⚡ The user enters the text they want to translate
-  ⚡ The user provides a language code for translation (e.g., fr for French)
-  ⚡ The script translates the text and displays the translated output
-  ⚡ Users can view a list of available languages that start with any specified letter
-  ⚡ The process can be repeated until the user exits

🔧 Usage Instructions

-  🔹 Run the script
-  🔹 Enter the text to translate or type "e" to exit
-  🔹 Provide the target language code
-  🔹 View the translated output
-  🔹 Optionally, check available languages starting with a specific letter

🛠 Error Handling

-  ⚠️ If an invalid language code is entered, the script displays an error message
-  ⚠️ If translation fails for any reason, a general error message is shown

📜 Example Output

- 🔎 Text ["e" to exit]: Hello
